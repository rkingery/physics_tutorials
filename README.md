# Physics Tutorials

This repository is intended to house any tutorials I write of a physics-related nature. The expectations is that these will be similar to those in my [ML Tutorials repository](https://github.com/rkingery/ml_tutorials), except with a much stronger focus on physics and applied math, and less focus on machine learning specifics. These tutorials are often initially written for my own personal benefit, to help me understand concepts better, but feel free to use or adapt anything you wish.
